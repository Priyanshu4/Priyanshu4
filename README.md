I am a Computer Science and Electrical Engineering student at the University of Connecticut. I am an aspiring software engineer with interests in robotics, embedded systems and machine learning. I am looking for internships for summer 2024.

## Work Experience
**Software Engineering Intern** at [Raytheon BBN](https://www.rtx.com/who-we-are/we-are-rtx/transformative-technologies/bbn) during the summer of 2023. I built a suite of tools in C++ and MATLAB to test signal processing hardware.

**Undergraduate Research Assistant** at the [Pratt & Whitney Institute of Advanced Systems Engineering](https://iase.engr.uconn.edu/) during the 2022-2023 school year. I developed an interface allowing a MagicDraw SysML (Systems Modeling Language) model to control and 
communicate with an autonomous rover in real time.

**Test Software Engineering Intern** at [Butterfly Network](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/) during the summer of 2022. I developed a Flask web app allowing test operators to easily configure and monitor multiple test programs for Butterfly IQ ultrasound probes.

## Projects
Manipulator Motion Planning Research (Ongoing) - I am currently working with a robotics professor to independently research motion planning algorithms for industrial manipulators.

[Fake Review Farm Detection](https://github.com/Priyanshu4/Fake-Review-Farm-Detection) - For a machine learning course, I implemented and tested an approach to detect groups of fake reviewers on e-commerce websites. I used graph convolution and hierarchical clustering to detect anomalously dense groups of similar users in a bipartite graph which represents interactions between users and items.

[Daily Trivia](https://github.com/Priyanshu4/H2O-daily-trivia) - Using a Raspberry Pi Pico and a 2 inch LCD screen, I built a game to decorate the outside of my dorm room door. Residents walking by can answer a new trivia question each day by pressing a button to select their response.

[Propositional Calculus](https://github.com/Priyanshu4/Propositional-Calculus) - For my discrete math course, I developed a Python package which can parse propositional logic expressions and check the validity of a logical argument.

[Raspberry Pi Robot](https://github.com/Priyanshu4/RPiRobot) - I built a 4-wheeled differential drive robot with a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi hosts a web server which streams live camera feed and allows the robot to be controlled remotely. Using OpenCV, the robot can also detect a colored line and autonomously follow it.

[Chess](https://github.com/Priyanshu4/Chess) - I developed a chess program in Java. It has a basic AI which uses a minimax search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
